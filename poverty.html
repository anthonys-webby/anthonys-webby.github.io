<h2>Why Im interested?</h2>
<p>I'm interested in this subject because many people, especially in countries like the United States, don't know how it is living in 3rd world countries and the severe poverty people who live there go through. I'd show people how it is living world.</p>

<h2>3rd world Coutries</h2>
<p>Third world countries are normally known as the developing countries of Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The term means generally poverty and many of these countries have millions living without education, hungry and working just to feed themselves and nothing more. Also in these countries there is very few opputunities and jobs pay very little just enough to feed families. The government are very weak and much crime is comminted in these coutries. Sadly many have to live in this unsafe envoriment and for them leaving the country cost to much.(plane ticket or ride) </p>
