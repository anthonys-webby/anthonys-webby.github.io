<h2>High School</h2>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what high school I will be attending. It will either be Lakewood high school or Millikan high school. I may even change districts. In any high school I attend I will apply to be in a medical, technology, or College prep program. Also I plan to be in AP classes throughout my years in highschool and try out for the school's soccer team.</p>

I believe my major would be in a medical or technology based but I'm not sure at this time.</p>
